# Gold-Price-Prediction

=> Project Overview
- The project demonstrates the following key steps:

=> Data Collection and Processing

1. Loading and cleaning the data.
- Checking for missing values and data inconsistencies.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand correlations between variables.

2. Data Visualization
- Heatmap to visualize feature correlations.
- Distribution plot for the gold prices (GLD).

3. Model Development
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- Training the model using Random Forest Regressor.
- Evaluating model performance using RÂ² score on both train and test data.

4. Prediction & Visualization
- Comparison of actual vs predicted gold prices for both training and testing datasets using line plots.

=> Future Improvements
- Explore more advanced models such as XGBoost or LSTM.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning to improve the model performance further.
- Add more features like macroeconomic indicators to enhance predictive power.
